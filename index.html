        <h2 class="featurette-heading">It is easier to go down a hill than up, but the view is from the top.<span class="text-muted">  It’ll blow your mind.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">When the sun slowly peeps over the range of mountains, birds shake the morning dew off their feathers and give a cheerful song that would lift even the most sorrowful of spirits. A light fog wraps around the mountain range, reaching to touch every bit of life thriving there. The slight chill in the air is enough to give a gentle shiver, but not enough for the need of a jacket. A breeze tickles the trees, making their leaves shake and sway with laughter. Sunlight seeps in past the thick canopy of branches with hopes of being able to reach the damp mountain earth. The mountains are the best place to live to be relaxed, see the most beauty, and never get bored.There is a relaxing feel of the mountains making it perfect for letting the stress disappear and peace to find its way to one’s soul. There are many people who love the mountains and live in them, but there is so much space that they hardly ever see each other. Less people means that there is less judgement by them, which means there is more freedom to be the person wanted to be without worry about that pesky inner critic.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Oh yeah, it’s that good.The Symbol of inner Peace.<span class="text-muted">  See for yourself.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Inner peace means being mentally and spiritually calm and in sync with your emotions despite the everyday challenges of life. It means having the knowledge and understanding to keep calm, focused and unshaken even in the in the face of discord and stress.

            There are many reasons why inner peace is important in all aspects of life. When you have peace of mind, you’ll not be swayed by what people think about you or the events and challenges you encounter.

            It will help you focus better on your goals and become more efficient in handling your daily affairs. Besides, taking the steps to achieve inner peace will improve your mood, develop patience and make your life more fulfilling.

            Having inner peace will not only be beneficial to you, but it will also help you bring peace to your external world. So how can you instill it?

            For starters, always perceive yourself and your life positively. Showing gratitude and being mindful of the present will also help you improve your mental well-being. Besides, always remember to exercise, eat good meals, be helpful to others and take good care of yourself.

            Peace of mind is crucial if you want to make full use of your Everyday Power.</p>

            The world as we know it has know it
            Has gone through dramatic and violent changes

            In order to avoid this, the goverment developed
            An artificial intelligence system
            In order to keep control of the situation...
            We don't know how humankind will react
            But remember, all we do, is care about you...

            They'll rise!

            A shattered law and mechanic rules
            Manipulating our kind
            Brainwash and delusion pits
            Breaking down through my mind
            You're just like one of them
            Shut your mouth and behold!
            Lack of freedom and waves of lies
            Torturing my soul

            How many times I'll have to
            Break myself apart
            Against this life and the answers
            That I put aside?
            This paradox I live
            Day by day I'm still searching for me
            But something's tying me

            The second phase of mechanization will now start,
            Memories, feelings, ideals and any obstructer
            To our new better world will be executed

            They'll rise!</p>
